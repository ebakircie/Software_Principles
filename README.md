# Software Principles

Software Pirinciples are recommendations or best practices for developers that they should benefit while coding in order to avoid repeating the same thing over and over or write cleaner, understandable and maintainable code. 
For example those recommendations are; 

# DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself!
It aims to reduce repetition of patterns and practices which means  whenever implementing new technology or modificate any single part of system should not require a change in any other part which related to modificated one.

# KISS: Keep It Simple Stupid
This principle basicly saying that whole system would work better if system kept simple rather than complicated. While designing anything __unnecessary complexity__ should be avoided in order to prevent sustainability of system.
